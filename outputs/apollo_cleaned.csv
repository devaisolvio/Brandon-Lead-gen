We make it our mission to offer premier entertainment services, in so many different forms. Our parks are designed and built by the best in the industry to maximize safety. Flying Squirrel Sports trampoline park structures include: shock absorbing suspension mounts, a connection system with a pivoting bed rail and a german gas shock absorber assembly incorporated directly into the trampoline framework. The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks. Unlike all OTHER TRAMPOLINE PARKS which are built using straight steel frames which underlie the vinyl foam pad attached to the top. The foam pad is the only soft surface that protects the jumper from injury when landing on the trampoline frame. Flying Squirrel Sports welcomes you to the future of trampoline parks!
