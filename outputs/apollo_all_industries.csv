We make it our mission to offer premier entertainment services, in so many different forms. Our parks are designed and built by the best in the industry to maximize safety. Flying Squirrel Sports trampoline park structures include: shock absorbing suspension mounts, a connection system with a pivoting bed rail and a german gas shock absorber assembly incorporated directly into the trampoline framework. The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks. Unlike all OTHER TRAMPOLINE PARKS which are built using straight steel frames which underlie the vinyl foam pad attached to the top. The foam pad is the only soft surface that protects the jumper from injury when landing on the trampoline frame. Flying Squirrel Sports welcomes you to the future of trampoline parks!

To be relentless in helping you thrive in life

THE GAMEDAY PROMISES:

High Quality – Gameday uses only Bioidentical hormones, which are identical in structure to what your body already makes. A safe, effective, and natural treatment compared to synthetic hormones.

Quick and Simple Process – A quick blood test to check your testosterone levels and a one on one consultation with our medical provider. If you qualify for low T treatment, you can begin immediately. 

Effective treatment programs – Within weeks of beginning treatment, most men experience higher energy levels, deeper sleep, and notice increased muscle mass. Results may vary for each man, however, our medical providers are available 7 days a week to make sure your treatment is progressing safely and effectively.

Designed for men on-the-go – We know you're busy. This is why we've developed our program so that, if you qualify, you can administer all your medication from home or on the road.",,,,,"cloudflare hosting, cloudflare dns, gmail, google apps, mailchimp mandrill"

Just as a successful movie requires a great location, extraordinary talent, impressive technical skills, an amazing art department, and a strong backbone crew, so does a special event.  More importantly, like a great movie, a great event must tell a compelling story.  Every event has a purpose and a message; ZOē works diligently and collaboratively with its clients to tell that story through an interactive experience, employing tools and elements that play upon all five senses. ""Branding"" is big business; whether it be corporate, celebrity, non-profit, or entertainment; a brand goes beyond a logo and incorporates the message of an entity; it's style, it's genre, it's sensibility. Just as the word suggests, a brand can make an indelible mark, and a live event is the perfect place to make it sizzle.  Managing elements such as the food and beverage program, entertainment, design and decor, and technical production, ZOē infuses messaging from every direction, making each experience an investment.",11701000,11.7M,,,"android, apache, flutter, gmail, google analytics, google apps, google tag manager, mobile friendly, python, remote, sharepoint, typekit, vimeo, wordpress.org"

We play ComedySportz! About the ComedySportz Show:

ComedySportz -- Portland's longest-running show - is fast-paced, clean, family-friendly and competitive improvisational comedy. We've played every weekend since May 28, 1993.

Two teams alternate improvised scenes, games and songs, and the audience votes for the team they like better. A referee explains the rules, calls the ComedySportz fouls, and solicits suggestions from the audience to inspire every scene/game. The ref is our secret weapon - the ref keeps it moving and keeps it clean.

ComedySportz is 100 percent family and business friendly. It's a show that entertains everyone with offending anyone - our regular show audiences features bachelor parties, church groups, senior citizens, teenagers, kids and adults at the same time.

The company continued to grow with us purchasing the Perry House, our beautiful venue that offers beautiful views of the Bay and a great proximity to downtown Monterey. 
In 2016, another great opportunity came with us working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation on a New Vision for the historic Cooper Molera Adobe property right in downtown Monterey. With a lot of hard work, we started to lease the newly renovated Barns at Cooper Molera, holding our first event in July of 2018! 
Yes, another opportunity presented itself as we became the proud leaseholder of what is known as the Monterey Beach House. We are looking forward to doing a few renovations on this property as well! 
With our businesses massive growth, we had to make a few hard decisions and ended up closing down our venue, Gatherings, in 2019 and stop our Monterey Beach Wedding Service as well.

Owner and Executive Chef Philippe Massoud expertly crafts a sophisticated blend
of modern and traditional Lebanese cuisine drawing influences from the span of the ancient Silk Road trade routes. Flavorful herbs and spices combine to delight the palate; earthy and delicate textures emerge from innovative combinations of savory and sweet; each bite reveals a deeper story behind the birth of the Eastern Mediterranean culinary culture.

Our warm and generous hospitality drives our mission to make every guest and team member feel genuinely welcomed and fundamentally honored. We are here to share; to pass fresh pita bread and mezze amongst old friends and new; to celebrate life and its delicious bounty.

We invite you to experience our old world hospitality, timeless generosity, and tireless dedication to uncovering and sharing the rich traditions of Lebanon and the Levant.",,,,,"7shifts, ai, audioeye, circle, emma, facebook custom audiences, facebook login (connect), facebook widget, google font api, google maps, google maps (non paid users), google tag manager, heapanalytics, microsoft office 365, mobile friendly, nginx, outlook, remote, stripe, typekit, varnish, zoominfo, recaptcha"
