Flying Squirrel was founded by two enterprising entrepreneurs Luke Schueler and Cody Schueler in 2015. 

We make it our mission to offer premier entertainment services, in so many different forms. Our parks are designed and built by the best in the industry to maximize safety. Flying Squirrel Sports trampoline park structures include: shock absorbing suspension mounts, a connection system with a pivoting bed rail and a german gas shock absorber assembly incorporated directly into the trampoline framework. The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks. Unlike all OTHER TRAMPOLINE PARKS which are built using straight steel frames which underlie the vinyl foam pad attached to the top. The foam pad is the only soft surface that protects the jumper from injury when landing on the trampoline frame. Flying Squirrel Sports welcomes you to the future of trampoline parks!

To always understand how valuable your time is
To treat you as a teammate and answer any and all of your questions
To create game plans specifically tailored to your unique needs and goals

To be relentless in helping you thrive in life

THE GAMEDAY PROMISES:

High Quality – Gameday uses only Bioidentical hormones, which are identical in structure to what your body already makes. A safe, effective, and natural treatment compared to synthetic hormones.

Quick and Simple Process – A quick blood test to check your testosterone levels and a one on one consultation with our medical provider. If you qualify for low T treatment, you can begin immediately. 

Effective treatment programs – Within weeks of beginning treatment, most men experience higher energy levels, deeper sleep, and notice increased muscle mass. Results may vary for each man, however, our medical providers are available 7 days a week to make sure your treatment is progressing safely and effectively.

Designed for men on-the-go – We know you're busy. This is why we've developed our program so that, if you qualify, you can administer all your medication from home or on the road.",,,,,"cloudflare hosting, cloudflare dns, gmail, google apps, mailchimp mandrill"
