Flying Squirrel was founded by two enterprising entrepreneurs Luke Schueler and Cody Schueler in 2015. 

We make it our mission to offer premier entertainment services, in so many different forms. Our parks are designed and built by the best in the industry to maximize safety. Flying Squirrel Sports trampoline park structures include: shock absorbing suspension mounts, a connection system with a pivoting bed rail and a german gas shock absorber assembly incorporated directly into the trampoline framework. The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks. Unlike all OTHER TRAMPOLINE PARKS which are built using straight steel frames which underlie the vinyl foam pad attached to the top. The foam pad is the only soft surface that protects the jumper from injury when landing on the trampoline frame. Flying Squirrel Sports welcomes you to the future of trampoline parks!

In 2016, another great opportunity came with us working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation on a New Vision for the historic Cooper Molera Adobe property right in downtown Monterey.

Yes, another opportunity presented itself as we became the proud leaseholder of what is known as the Monterey Beach House. We are looking forward to doing a few renovations on this property as well! 
With our businesses massive growth, we had to make a few hard decisions and ended up closing down our venue, Gatherings, in 2019 and stop our Monterey Beach Wedding Service as well.

Owner and Executive Chef Philippe Massoud expertly crafts a sophisticated blend
of modern and traditional Lebanese cuisine drawing influences from the span of the ancient Silk Road trade routes. Flavorful herbs and spices combine to delight the palate; earthy and delicate textures emerge from innovative combinations of savory and sweet; each bite reveals a deeper story behind the birth of the Eastern Mediterranean culinary culture.

Our warm and generous hospitality drives our mission to make every guest and team member feel genuinely welcomed and fundamentally honored. We are here to share; to pass fresh pita bread and mezze amongst old friends and new; to celebrate life and its delicious bounty.

Flying Squirrel was founded by two enterprising entrepreneurs Luke Schueler and Cody Schueler in 2015. 

We make it our mission to offer premier entertainment services, in so many different forms. Our parks are designed and built by the best in the industry to maximize safety. Flying Squirrel Sports trampoline park structures include: shock absorbing suspension mounts, a connection system with a pivoting bed rail and a german gas shock absorber assembly incorporated directly into the trampoline framework. The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks. Unlike all OTHER TRAMPOLINE PARKS which are built using straight steel frames which underlie the vinyl foam pad attached to the top. The foam pad is the only soft surface that protects the jumper from injury when landing on the trampoline frame. Flying Squirrel Sports welcomes you to the future of trampoline parks!

In 2006, they opened their first special events venue, Gatherings, along with Jim & Cheryl Cox. 
In 2008, Monterey Beach Weddings was born to create a ""whole"" package for our Gatherings couples. In 2010, the team was able to acquire The Perry House in Monterey and has beautifully restored it as a special events facility.
The company continued to grow with us purchasing the Perry House, our beautiful venue that offers beautiful views of the Bay and a great proximity to downtown Monterey. 
In 2016, another great opportunity came with us working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation on a New Vision for the historic Cooper Molera Adobe property right in downtown Monterey. With a lot of hard work, we started to lease the newly renovated Barns at Cooper Molera, holding our first event in July of 2018! 
Yes, another opportunity presented itself as we became the proud leaseholder of what is known as the Monterey Beach House. We are looking forward to doing a few renovations on this property as well! 
With our businesses massive growth, we had to make a few hard decisions and ended up closing down our venue, Gatherings, in 2019 and stop our Monterey Beach Wedding Service as well.

The unique design allows the frames to pivot and travel up to 4 inches upon impact through the specific use of german shocks.

In 2016, another great opportunity came with us working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation on a New Vision for the historic Cooper Molera Adobe property right in downtown Monterey.

Yes, another opportunity presented itself as we became the proud leaseholder of what is known as the Monterey Beach House. We are looking forward to doing a few renovations on this property as well! 
With our businesses massive growth, we had to make a few hard decisions and ended up closing down our venue, Gatherings, in 2019 and stop our Monterey Beach Wedding Service as well.
