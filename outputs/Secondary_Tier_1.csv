ComedySportz -- Portland's longest-running show - is fast-paced, clean, family-friendly and competitive improvisational comedy. We've played every weekend since May 28, 1993.

Two teams alternate improvised scenes, games and songs, and the audience votes for the team they like better. A referee explains the rules, calls the ComedySportz fouls, and solicits suggestions from the audience to inspire every scene/game. The ref is our secret weapon - the ref keeps it moving and keeps it clean.

ComedySportz is 100 percent family and business friendly. It's a show that entertains everyone with offending anyone - our regular show audiences features bachelor parties, church groups, senior citizens, teenagers, kids and adults at the same time.
